        </u>
        <p> DHIU is founded upon the educational philosophy of Islam which in turn is inspired by the principles of
            hierarchy and unity of knowledge in its intents, contents and methods. Therefore, our philosophy is based
            on; Recognizing Allah, the almighty as the fountain- head of knowledge (al â€˜ allam); acknowledging him as
            the ultimate end of every human endeavors;PG EXAMINATION MAR-2023 REVALUATION RESULT PUBLISHED </p>

            <h2>DHIU</h2>
        </u>
        <p> DHIU was established as an Islamic Academy in 1986 and formally upgraded to a university in May 2009. The
            philosophy upheld by DHIU was the unique product of prolonged discourses and deliberations among great
            visionary scholars and supportive community leaders who were deeply concerned about the dichotomous view
            towards education as religious and secular. <div class="div1"> <a
